# Link Prefilling Documentation

At Formbricks, we believe in providing you with the tools and features to track the sources of your form submissions efficiently. Understanding the origin of submissions can be crucial for analysis, data categorization, and decision-making. That's why we offer the ability to track the source of each submission through a simple parameter called "source" in the URL.

## Tracking Sources with Formbricks

You can easily track the source of each form submission by appending a "source" parameter to the URL when sharing your form link. For example:

- To track submissions from WhatsApp, append `?source=whatsapp` to your form link.
- For submissions coming from email, use `?source=email`.
- Similarly, you can use `?source=instagram` or any other source identifier to categorize submissions accordingly.

Here's a quick example of how you can use the "source" parameter in your form link:

With this feature, you gain valuable insights into the origins of your responses, enabling you to tailor your approach and strategies effectively.
